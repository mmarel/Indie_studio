# Installation

Bombtlet requires updating your graphics drivers if this is not done.

### For Linux
Install the dependencies.
```sh
$ make install
```
Build from sources:
```sh
$ make build
```

### For Windows
in progress..

### Docker
Bauntlet is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 80, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
docker build -t marwane-khsime/bauntlet:${package.json.version}
```
This will create the bauntlet image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Bauntlet.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 80 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/bauntlet:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
ping localhost:8000
```
